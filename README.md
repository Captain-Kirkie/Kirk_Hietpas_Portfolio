# Kirk Hietpas - Portfolio! Software Dude!

Hello! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Kirk Hietpas, a passionate software engineer based in Salt Lake City, UT. My expertise lies primarily in backend development, though I also enjoy diving into full stack projects from time to time. Iâ€™m excited to share my work with you and provide insight into my development journey.

## About Me

With a strong background in designing and implementing robust backend systems, I specialize in creating scalable and efficient solutions that drive modern applications. My skill set includes working with various technologies, frameworks, and methodologies to deliver high-quality software. While my focus is on backend development, I also have experience with frontend technologies, allowing me to contribute effectively to full stack projects.

Day to day I work with Server Side Swift, [Vapor](https://github.com/vapor/vapor) and [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) buildings APIs for my current company [PassiveLogic](https://passivelogic.com/).

I have a Bacholer degree in Biology from the University of Minnesota - Duluth with a minor in Chemistry. In 2021 I made the switch to a career in tech with a Master of Software Development degree from the Univeristy of Utah.

In my free time I love to get outdoors. I am an avid Climber, Runner, Biker, Skier.
